/**
	7.44. Write a complete C++ program that asks the user for a number n and prints n squares made of
	âˆ— symbols each with an upward diagonal stripe made of O symbols. Each square has height n and width 
	n and the squares form a horizontal sequence.
	
	For example, if the user specified 4 for n, the program would print as follows:

	***O ***O ***O ***O
	**O* **O* **O* **O*
	*O** *O** *O** *O**
	O*** O*** O*** O***
